# wireshark_852
This is a wireshark dissector for the ISO/IEC 14908-4 (additionally known as ANSI/CTA 852) protocol with LON payload. It is implemented in LUA to be independent of a C++ environment.

Even if there is already a C++ writen DLL for ISO/IEC 14908-4, a lua-version is more flexible and can be easier extended by all skilled users.
